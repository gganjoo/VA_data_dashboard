This GUI is still in development utilizing QT.  The pages are independent, mainwindow and roster have been linked.  There were issues importing the keys into the roster and then transferring
to the provider portal that still need to be addressed.  Once this is complete all three screens will be interlocked.  After this is complete, error raising issues (producing a popup, and event log will 
be created to address exceptions.  For functionality this module needs to stay together, but will be cleaned up in future updates.
