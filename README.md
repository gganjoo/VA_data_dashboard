# Project2_Gonzalez_Ganjoo_Ferniza

This is out submissionn for W200 project 2. We created a dashboard that created graphs out of publically available DOD reports and individual soldier data to highlight an individual's risks for suicide. 

Our main program can be run by entering 'python soldier_graphs.py' in the command line. The user will then be provided with 42 dodids that they can enter to see an individual's visualization. 

soldier_graphs.py accesses the 'JSON_data_files' folder and the Soldier_data_fake_20210409.csv file

The 'Data Parse Notes & Methods' notebook shows how we initially cleaned up data from the DOD reports to be converted into JSONs.
